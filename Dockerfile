# We need Emscripten 2.0.31 or newer, something including: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/commit/e36ffafa8956e5181e62b2a446b193628adb94d2
# This makes using dladdr not fail, and provides a stub like implementation isntead.
# Building with 2.0.32 seems to fail with `undefined symbol wait4`, so use 2.0.31 instead.
# It might be related to this change: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/commit/be2fe9cdf2d6b7b9d0fc375177b9a18a2810fca4
# Probably it's `define`d as a different symbol.
